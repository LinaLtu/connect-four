# Connect Four

On the 3rd week of Full Stack JavaScript Web Development coding bootcamp at SPICED Academy, I built a game, using vanilla JavaScript and jQuery.

Connect four is a two-player game in which the players take turns dropping colored discs from the top into a seven-column, six-row vertically suspended grid. The player, who first forms a horizontal, vertical or diagonal line of four of one's own discs, wins the game.
